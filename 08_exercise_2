#Create a new table:

B = ( Date = ("8/12/2012","8/12/2012","11/01/2013","11/01/2013"; Depth = (0,-2,0,-2); Temperature = (10,9,8,8)  )

replace Depth with the absolute value. Add one more observation:
21/01/2013 -1 9
Suggestion: use matrix and abs


#Create a new table A similar to the previous, with random values and:

append A to B

# Create a new table with the following columns:

Region= (...two regions...)

append the column region to the matrix
